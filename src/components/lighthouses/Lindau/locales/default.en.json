It was completed in 1856, when it took over the portâ€™s previous light station in the Mangtrum Tower, constructed in 1230. The 108 foot tall structure is quite unique among lighthouses because it also houses a massive clock that can be viewed from the city.","figure":{"alt":"Photo of Lindau Lighthouse","credits":"Photo: Andreas Flohr"}}
